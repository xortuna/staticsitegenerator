# Static Site Generator in C# #

After being frustrated by the complexity and 'time to site' of the most popular templating engines, I found they are not really good fit for any web developers who can already code the page theme in HTML and just want to wrap content in a repeatable way.

Its designed to be dirt simple to use and satisfy the most basic requirements: Page header, nav bar, content and finally page footer. 
An example of a web page using this is the https://pisteapp.com website.

## Features

* HTML Templating
* Markdown content
* Asset copying
* Easy to use Functions and macros to automate templated elements 
* Context aware variable system  
* Automatic image resolution selection/webp fallback

## Command Line

Run Static web generator inside any working directory you want to generate your website in.
```
cd mysite
StaticSiteGenerator.exe -w -x "https://mysite.com"
cd _www
python3 -m http.server
```

## Arguments
| Argument      | Description      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| -w | Watch the input folder for changes |
| -mi | Dont auto detect multi resolution images |
| -t | Add additional asset file types (DEF: ".css", ".png", ".svg", ".js", ".webp", ".mp4", ".webm") |
| -x "https://mysite.com" | Set the Base URL and generate a sitemap.xml |

## The basics

Anything HTML will be copyed into its relative directory inside the output folder (_www/) so legal/eula.html will become _www/legal/eula.html.
Anything thats an asset (.jpg, .png) will also be copied to the releative location so images/dog.png will become _www/images/dog.png
Anything you do NOT want copied should start with an underscore e.g _workingSection/mysecret.html will not be copied as its parent folder is exempt.

## The structuring

Before your files are copied a parser scans both HTML and Markdown files for templating syntax.
Files and folders starting with an underscore are not copied automatically but can still be referenced using the templating engine.
You therefore should put all your reusable components inside the _partial folder, the contents of this special folder is made global and can be included from any other html/md file.

**Important**
Example Structure for a blog:

```
/_partial/_header.html         Includes our CSS and JS
/_partial/_footer.html         Includes our copyright etc
/_partial/_navbar.html         Includes our navigation bar and menu
/assets/css/                   Contains asset files that are copied
/assets/js/                    Contains asset files that are copied
/assets/image/                 Contains asset files that are copied 
/blog/index.html               Page showing a list of blog posts
/blog/posts/__template.html    The HTML template the blog posts should use
/blog/posts/mypost1.md         A blog post content
/blog/posts/mypost2.md         A blog post content
```

When running the tool a new folder called _www will be created, any assets or HTML files will be copied into the relevant directories, and Markdown files will be parsed and exploded into subdirectories

```
_www/assets/css/
_www/assets/js/
_www/assets/image/
_www/blog/index.html
_www/blog/posts/mypost1/index.html
_www/blog/posts/mypost2/index.html
```

# Templating Engine

The templating engine is basic, and primerially designed to help you automate placing partials around the page based on rules. Templates can be used in all HTML files, they cannot be used in markdown files.
The most common syntax you'll use is the include("myhtml.html") function to embed other html files into your html file.

Basic Syntax
```
<div>
{{include('helloworld.html')}}
</div>

Becomes

<div>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

Nested Functions are evaluated automatically

Function Syntax
```
The answer is: {{add(multiply(2, 2),10)}}

Becomes

The answer is: 14

```

You can also use LINQ style syntax where the left hand parameter is deduced from the preceding elements

```
Linq Syntax
{{list_files('/blog/posts','*.md').take(5)}}

Basic Syntax:
{{take(list_files('/blog/posts','*.md'), 5)}}

```

Inline Operations

Sometimes its easier to just write operations as you would, remember the operators work left to right so you'll need to use brackets to explicitly define the order of mathmatical operations you may want
```
{{4*5+8}}

Outputs
28

(3-(1+1))

Outputs
1
```

## Variables

Variables can be used to store and retrive data, their type is determed by the function using the variable. But conceptually you can treat them as strings.

```
{{assign('MyVar', 5)}}

The Number is: {{var('MyVar')}}

Becomes

The Number is: 5
```


Variables can also be generated by functions:

```
assign('myArray, to_array('1,2,3'))

foreach(var(myArray),concat('The number is:',var(foreach.key)))

Becomes

The number is: 1
The number is: 2
The number is: 3

```

And assigned based on the included file

```
## Inside index.html
include('myPartial.html')

## Inside myPartial.html
My owner is {{var('input.name')}}
And I am {{var('partial.name')}}

Becomes
My owner is index.html
And I am myPartial.html
```

When including files, any previously assigned variables are still in scope of the included file. 


Here we have a Navigation partial that has a menu, we want the menu to highlight which section of the website we are currently in.
Using inheritance the Nagivation partial's current directory variable contains the path of the page that *included* the navbar, we test the start of that path so no matter how deep into the navigation all the pages get the correct nav bar highlight.

```HTML
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
	<ul class="navbar-nav ms-auto">
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link {{if(equal(var('directory.path'),''),'active','')}}" href="/">
        <span>Home</span>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link {{if(starts_with(var('directory.path'),'/features'),'active')}}" href="/features/">
        <span>Features</span>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link {{if(starts_with(var('directory.path'),'/download'),'active')}}" href="/download/">
        <span>Download</span>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link {{if(starts_with(var('directory.path'),'/blog'),'active')}}" href="/blog/">
        <span>Blog</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## Example full HTML using templates

One of the most common templating examples is the need to make a page that shows recent blog posts.

Our blog posts are all written out as markdown files and we want to show a collection of the most recent ones for the user to browse though and click, at the root of our Blog we create

/blog/index.html -

We include our headers, a nav bar, a list of recent blog posts and a footer.

``` HTML
{#page.title:Blog Posts#}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <!-- Global header includes (JS files, fonts etc) -->
  {{include('_header.html')}}
  <meta name="description" content="List of blog posts published by Piste">
  <title>Piste: {{var(page.title)}}</title>
</head>

<body class="d-flex flex-column min-vh-100">
  <!-- Static Top Menu -->
  {{include('_navbar.html')}}

  <!-- Content -->
  <div class="content container my-4">
    <h1>New Ski Blog Posts</h1>
    <div class="row">
      {{foreach(list_files('/blog/posts','*.md'),load_metadata(var('foreach.key'), include('_blogpost_stub.html')))}}
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Footer -->
  {{include('_footer.html')}}
</body>
</html>
```

We want each posts link to show the title and a small subtext of what the blog post is about to attract the user to click on ti,
This is best done as a template stub. But before we include our _blogpost_stub.html, first we need to bring the post's metadata into scope so it can be referenced, we can use load_metadata on our file path (which is stored in the foreach.key variable) to do this.
Once we've loaded the meta data we can then run the stub which will pull the variables out of the working scope and put them on screen.

/_partial/_blogpost_stub.html
```HTML
<div class="row g-0
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <img src="{{var('post.image')}}" class="blog-image img-fluid rounded-start" alt="Blog Post Image">
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">{{var('post.title')}}</h5>
      <p class="card-text">{{var('post.caption')}}</p>
      <div class="card-text" style="text-align: right;">
        <a href="{{get_url(var('foreach.key'))}}"
          class="btn btn-primary stretched-link float-right">Continue reading...</a>
        <br />
        <small class="text-muted">{{var('post.date')}}</small>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Example Markdown ##

Markdown files can be used to ease of content creation without the hassle of authoring individual HTML files. The markdown files get combined with a __template.html file to create a html sub directory.

Traditional templating syntax is not supported in markdown, but the metadata syntax is supported.

e.g mypost.md gets transformed into /mypost/index.html

/blog/posts/mypost1.md An example blog post with meta data prefixed (the metadata is used in the template to describe the page title, post date etc)
```MARKDOWN
{#post.title:Top 5 Ski Runs in Val d'Isère#}
{#post.date:16 September 2024#}
{#post.resort:Tignes Val d'Isere#}
{#post.caption:Did your favorite run make the list?#}
{#post.image:/assets/image/blog/topskirunvaldisere/header.png#}
# Top 5 Ski Runs in Val d'Isère

Heading off to Val d'Isère or Tignes this year? Don't miss these top runs. From beginner green to icy half pipes we think you'll find a favourite in our mix.

## 5. Glacier - Val d'Isere

![Glacier](/assets/image/blog/topskirunvaldisere/5.webp)

![float-end inline-image][Map of Glacier Piste](/assets/image/blog/topskirunvaldisere/5_map.png)

Val d'Isere has its own Glacier to rival Tignes's Grand Motte. A high-altitude gem that offers spectacular skiing on pristine snow, thanks to its location atop the Pissaillas Glacier. As a blue run, it provides a wide, gentle descent, making it ideal for intermediate skiers while offering stunning panoramic views of the surrounding peaks. The reliable snow conditions and breathtaking scenery make it a must-visit, particularly in the early season when lower-altitude runs may lack coverage. It’s a smooth, enjoyable ride with excellent snow, perfect for skiers looking to experience glacier skiing.
```

We obviously want to wrap our blog post into an actual HTML page, so we use the directory level __template.html to do this.

/blog/posts/__template.html an example template for all blog posts to compile into

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  {{include('_header.html')}}
  <meta name="description" content="{{var('post.caption')}}">
  <title>{{var('post.title')}}</title>
  <link href="/assets/css/piste_blog.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

<body class="d-flex flex-column min-vh-100">
  <!-- Static Top Menu -->
  {{include('_navbar.html')}}

  <!-- Content -->
  <div class="content container my-4">
    <!-- Breadcrumb -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <nav aria-label="breadcrumb">
          <ol class="breadcrumb">
            <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li class="breadcrumb-item" aria-current="page"><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></li>
            <li class="breadcrumb-item active" aria-current="page">{{var('post.title')}}</li>
          </ol>
        </nav>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <small class="float-end">Posted {{var('post.date')}}</small>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <!-- Insert the markdown body here -->
        {{var('content')}}
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 d-none d-md-block">
        <h2>Related Posts</h2>
        {{
        foreach(list_files('/blog/posts','*.md').where(notequal(var('where.key'),var('input.fullname'))).take(5),
        load_metadata(var('foreach.key'),include('_blogpost_stub_horizontal.html')))}}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Footer -->
  {{include('_footer.html')}}
</body>
</html>
```
